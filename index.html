              <h2>Winter Calendar</h2>
              <p>Founded after the Brexit vote, Volt is a pan-european, participative and progressive movement. We are active in 32 countries and have registered political parties in 13 with our goal of trying to be the voice for all those that believe in the necessity of a stronger, more democratic and transparent Europe.</p>
              <p>We want to use this calendar to present our program for the upcoming European elections, called the Amsterdam Declaration. The Declaration was created by Volt volunteers from all over Europe and accepted on our national assembly in Amsterdam. We will introduce one of our propositions every day until the end of the year.</p>
              <p>Follow the calendar, share and discuss proposals and concrete steps with us on social media or join us  to help adapt policies on national and local levels as well as to prepare for the European Elections</p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Asylum Seekers and Refugees</h2>
              <p>Manage refugee flows from outside the EU, by setting up a Unified EU Refugee System. The Dublin System must be reformed and complemented by a settlement scheme which provides for penalties and sanctions against States refusing to fulfil their responsibility</p>
              <p>Make the asylum system fair, effective and quick, by issuing EU guidelines that ensure shorter asylum procedures and provide for social, legal and psychological support.</p>
              <p>Ensure successful integration and a benefit for the economy. Asylum seekers must be able to enter the job market from day one, and their skills must be more easily recognised. In addition, language training must be offered to all asylum seekers.</p>
              <p>Protect those in need, by classifying famine and climate migrants as refugees under European law and by strengthening the use of humanitarian corridors</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>European Governance</h2>
              <p>Establish a Federal Europe with a European Government, headed by a Prime Minister elected by the Parliament, and with a President elected by the people. This will create a strong, open and transparent European parliamentary democracy.</p>
              <p>Enable the creation of real EU political parties. Current EU parties are loose coalitions of national parties, often with conflicting interests; a real EU democracy needs strong parties defending their vision of the future of Europe.</p>
              <p>Ensure the EU’s ability to act by deciding by majority on all issues in the Councils. Currently, States still decide on many issues by unanimity or consensus, making it far easier to block than to act.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Inclusion and Accessible Government</h2>
              <p>Remove barriers to voting for the European Parliament, by testing electronic voting to offer voters better accessibility to elections, including expatriates and those with reduced mobility.</p>
              <p>Grant better access to public services and make it easy to interact with EU administrations, by introducing an e-ID and by digitalizing the EU administration.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>European Security and Defense</h2>
              <p>Boost European defense capabilities, by establishing a European army of committed Member States, while working towards the creation of EU-wide permanent forces with a unified EU military command under civilian control.</p>
              <p>Strengthen European internal security, by turning the EU’s current law enforcement agency (Europol) into a true federal-level police force and granting it authority to fight crossborder crime, terrorism and cybersecurity threats.</p>
              <p>Ensure the safety of the EU’s digital infrastructure, by making all EU software open source. This will reduce the dependency on monopolistic companies and will make our institutions cheaper, more transparent, and more resilient to data breaches.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Create New Jobs</h2>
              <p>Channel EU funds in challenged regions to create jobs, by sponsoring smart and environmentally friendly investments, such as high-speed railway connections, improved accessibility and connectivity to rural areas and clean, local energy production sites.</p>
              <p>Increase public spending on professional and vocational education, to increase lifelong employability and the international competitiveness of apprentices. A special focus will be placed on areas with high long-term unemployment.</p>
              <p>Make it easier to find a job across Europe, by setting up a real European Labour Platform to match the unemployed and employers across Europe. Expand the European Employment Services (EURES) and foster better cooperation with the private sector in order to move towards a truly united labour market.</p>
              <p>Invest in programmes supporting decentralised digital labour, by providing devices and digital skills trainings at low costs. Investments will be focused on regions with high unemployment rates and with low level of digital skills or access to technology.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Education Investment</h2>
              <p>Enable more people to experience different European countries, by increasing the budget for EU exchange programmes (ERASMUS+), especially for secondary school students, apprentices and disadvantaged students.</p>
              <p>Make sure that everyone can keep up with a rapidly evolving society, by extending lifelong learning to all, throughout their professional and personal lives.</p>
              <p>Bring education to the next level, by increasing EU funding for teachers, school teachers, and introducing new teaching methods. This will adequately address how different students learn best and enhance their educational success.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>No One Left Behind</h2>
              <p>Ensure decent living standards, by adopting a minimum income above poverty level in all Member States.</p>
              <p>Support people who lost their jobs in sectors or regions affected by economic crises, by doubling the funding of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and making it more flexible. These mechanisms will make the transition toward new jobs easier when a company ceases operations due to economic difficulties or moves outside the EU.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Equality &amp; Anti-Discrimination</h2>
              <p>Break the glass ceiling, by legally enforcing representation of women on publicly-listed corporate boards by 2025 and requiring businesses to report on gender pay and gender balance.</p>
              <p>Ensure that women’s rights are upheld, by legalizing and providing access to free abortion until the end of the first trimester, and providing free contraception everywhere across Europe.</p>
              <p>Guarantee equal rights to all, by ensuring access to the same procedures, rights and unions to every individual in society, including marriage for all.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Deliberation of Information</h2>
              <p>Strengthen tomorrow’s democracy with today’s education, by pushing States to include media literacy, citizenship education and knowledge of institutions in their curricula. This will strengthen EU citizens’ active engagement in public life.</p>
              <p>Create real, trustworthy European news, by introducing a common European Public Broadcasting Platform. This will supply EU citizens with an effective means of receiving information.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Minimize Climate Footprint</h2>
              <p>Grow the green economy, by introducing an EU-wide carbon tax and other forms of carbon pricing along the entire production chain and by ending subsidies on fossil-based fuel. The funds gained will be used for relevant climate mitigation and adaptation projects and to create new jobs.</p>
              <p>Use energy in a smarter way, by introducing smart electricity grids, by setting more ambitious energy-saving targets, and by creating incentives for green and low-energy public transportation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Government Transparency</h2>
              <p>Increase the transparency of the EU, by requiring elected officials to disclose their office expenses and spending.</p>
              <p>Protect the press and whistleblowers, by introducing strict guidelines limiting government punishment for the publication of confidential information in the public interest.</p>
              <p>Make all lobbying in the European Institutions transparent and monitored. The registration of all lobbying activities in the public transparency register will be made mandatory, and a strict code of conduct will be introduced.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Circular Economy</h2>
              <p>Truly kick-start the circular economy, by stimulating the provision of goods and services that are renewable and sustainable. This will be done by harmonizing tax incentives, speeding up the regulatory processes and providing funds to rethink the design and digitalisation of organisations, goods and services.</p>
              <p>Stop plastic-based pollution and reduce waste in general, by taxing the use of plastic, single-use products and polluted recyclables, and by banning the export of waste into non-EU countries.</p>
              <p>Move towards sustainable consumption and government spending, by introducing a Circular Economy Label, by adopting a green public procurement standard and by supporting resource sharing and product longevity.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Citizen Participation</h2>
              <p>Enable Europeans to participate in policy-making, by creating digital platforms and citizen assemblies. This will give people the possibility to give feedback on legislative proposals, take part in political decisions and shape their societies.</p>
              <p>Give Europeans a say in how the budget of the EU is allocated, by implementing participatory budgeting. EU citizens will be able to decide how a specific portion of EU funds is spent.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Fostering Innovation</h2>
              <p>Ensure European excellence in the future by doubling the spending on Research and Development to 4% of EU GDP by 2025. Push countries to invest in innovation to master the environmental and social challenges of tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Become smart in Artificial Intelligence, by creating the EU High Level Artificial Intelligence Coordination Office to gather the best minds and businesses in the field, set up a European AI Initiative, and establish high ethical standards for AI.</p>
              <p>Make Artificial Intelligence available and accessible for everyone, by increasing the European Investment Bank’s support for AI investments to at least €1 billion a year by 2020, and by setting up a centralised “AI-on-demandplatform” to provide a single access point to key AI resources in the EU.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Sustainable Agriculture</h2>
              <p>Support sustainable agriculture,  by refocusing the Common Agricultural Policy away from larger producers and towards smaller producers that use ecological approaches.</p>
              <p>Increase product quality and biodiversity, by supporting farms that manage land in accordance with local ecosystems, by focusing on connecting natural habitats, and by banning the use of pesticides and neonicotinoids.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>European Parliament</h2>
              <p>Empower Members of the European Parliament to fully represent citizens’interests by being able to propose bills. As the only directly-elected EU institution, the European Parliament must be given the right to initiate legislation – just like national parliaments.</p>
              <p>Ensure that the work of the Parliament is fully transparent and prevent last-minute rewrites and back-room deals. Record and make public all votes of Members of the European Parliament, and ensure a fixed time span for public review of bills before they are voted on.</p>
              <p>Ensure fair representation of all EU citizens  and strengthen the link between citizens and their representatives. This can be ensured by implementing the same voting rules for the European Parliament elections across the EU and by having citizens locally elect their Members of the European Parliament, whilst ensuring proportionality.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>A just Public Sector</h2>
              <p>End police violence and discriminatory treatment of minorities, by providing police training and revising laws, ending biased persecution and ensuring that the justice system does not discriminate against minorities.</p>
              <p>Aim for full equality and diversity for underrepresented groups in the public sector in Member States and in EU institutions, by putting in place preferential treatment, reporting on diversity and accommodating special needs.</p>
              <p>Ensure equal gender representation in EU politics and encourage female participation, by having gender-alternate lists of candidates and by other means, such as mandatory reporting on gender representation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Government Corruption</h2>
              <p>Make EU project funding dependent on national efforts to fight corruption. Member States combating corruption will see their efforts rewarded, and others failing to do so will be sanctioned.</p>
              <p>Stop corruption by granting new investigative powers to the European Anti-Fraud and Public Prosecutor’s Offices, and increase the competences of the European Ombudsman to include examining suspicious handling of public funds.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Inclusion, Affordable Housing</h2>
              <p>Make housing affordable, by integrating social and shared housing into the EU cohesion policy. Use available funds for social housing to improve the situation of low income groups, including marginalised groups, and urge Member States to subsidise shared social living.</p>
              <p>Alleviate child poverty by implementing a minimum standard for universal child benefits across the EU.</p>
        		</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Labour Migration</h2>
              <p>Protect both domestic and foreign workers against the negative effects of economic migration, by applying minimal harmonization among all European countries ensuring that access to basic social, legal and medical services is guaranteed.</p>
              <p>Turn Europe into a talent and innovation hub, by making it simpler and more attractive to obtain an expert visa, especially after acquiring a university degree from an EU Member State.</p>
              <p>Increase legal pathways into Europe, by developing a specific visa that will be made available to temporary foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Ensure that countries of origin and European countries benefit from temporary economic migration, by aligning the interest of both and by involving all relevant stakeholders (e.g., employers and trade unions) in the policy making process.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Economy and Finance</h2>
              <p>Make our economy stronger and sustainable through a Eurozone+ budget a Banking Union, and a full Economic and Monetary Union under a European Finance Minister who will represent the EU.</p>
              <p>Give the European Central Bank the power to support employment and growth, as well as prevent and solve financial crises. Beyond limiting inflation, the European Central Bank’s mandate must be expanded to promote employment, sustainable growth, and crisis prevention and mitigation.</p>
              <p>Ensure multinationals pay their fair share by collecting a minimum European corporate tax of 15% and harmonising corporate taxation across Member States. Tax avoidance by multinationals has undermined the financing of public services for decades.</p>
          	</div>
            <div>
              <h2>The Volta Programme</h2>
              <p>Establish the EU Volta Programme, that will provide comprehensive financial support for all training activities, including the reskilling and upskilling of people.</p>
              <p>Make it easier to study and work anywhere in Europe, by increasing the transparency and recognition of knowledge, skills, and competences.</p>
              <p>Increase the focus on digital literacy for all ages, by starting online education and coding at an early age, by introducing respective life-long learning and vocational trainings, and by emphasizing mental health and social well-being in digital environments.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Entrepeneurship</h2>
              <p>Make it easy to set up a business by creating a European Digital One Stop Shop. This will enable people to set up a business in 3 working days at a minimal administrative cost. To complement this, registration fees and processes will be harmonised and reporting, tax filing, and other government interactions will be streamlined across the EU.</p>
              <p>Boost entrepreneurship and the creation of jobs, by scaling up investments in technologies such as blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud technologies to help Europe's strategic sectors to compete globally.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Future of Work</h2>
              <p>Protect the dignity and safety of workers, especially in new sectors. Provide workers with non-traditional long-term contracts (e.g., gig, platform, freelance) with standards of protection comparable to those applicable to traditional forms of work.</p>
              <p>Create flexible workplaces via an EU-wide Working Time Choice Act, enabling workers and employers to negotiate flexible forms of work that reflect the needs of the individual, the team, and the business.</p>
              <p>Prepare the European labour force for the challenges of tomorrow, by setting up the European Sector Skills Council to research the skills needed in the future. This will enhance synergies between the private and public sector.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>... and since we have more propositions, we will continue until the end of the year.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Creating the Smart State of Tomorrow</h2>
              <p>Governments should provide high-quality public services for the benefit of their citizens and residents. Smart States must therefore continuously adapt to provide state-of-the-art public services in areas such as education, health care, and justice, to ensure social inclusion and equal opportunities. At the same time, new tools allow governments to increase their administrative effectiveness, fight corruption and earn their citizens' trust through accountable and transparent governance.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Economic Renaissance</h2>
              <p>European economies need to become the engine of society’s progress and allow for a decent living standard for all. For this, we established 3 key levers: rebuilding economically challenged areas, fostering leadership in innovation, and pushing for the EU to become a ‘Social Union’. This requires innovative policies to reduce bureaucracy, tackle unemployment, revive innovation, invest in smart & sustainable productivity and trade, and create a unified European social and fiscal system.</p>
          	</div>
            <div>
              <h2>Social Equality</h2>
              <p>In 2018, no one should still be left behind. Everyone in Europe has to be guaranteed equal rights and opportunities, and human rights need to be respected, applied, and upheld!  To achieve this aim, we are introducing groundbreaking and holistic policies that tackle all types of inequalities and discrimination, that aim to alleviate poverty, to include everyone in society and provide access to basic needs, and that emphasize a person’s right to their own body.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Achieving Global Balance</h2>
              <p>In today's interconnected world, and given the recent developments in the international policy arena, Europe needs to assume responsibility for its role in global challenges. These challenges include topics such as climate change, international fair trade, sustainable farming, food security, biodiversity, migration issues, and international development cooperation. This Challenge seeks to establish policies in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Citizen Empowerment</h2>
              <p>Europeans should be empowered to take informed political decisions, be able to influence politics beyond elections alone, and exercise their democratic rights within vibrant, resilient and highly deliberative democracies. Our policies are based on best practices regarding the fostering of a pluralistic information and media landscape, tools & technologies for political engagement and empowerment, and ways in which democracies can be made to thrive.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Programme for Reforming the EU</h2>
              <p>The European Union is our common project:  we have managed to come together and build a Union that has ensured peace and prosperity for over sixty years. Yet, it has its shortcomings, which is why we want to reform and strengthen EU governance and institutions for a more democratic, more transparent and stronger Europe, a federal Europe; and we propose concrete policies for more efficient EU action to promote and protect the interests of all European citizens.</p>
